      I've led cross-functional teams, modernized outdated systems, and
      developed full-stack applications that solve real-world problems. Whether
      I'm improving internal workflows or launching new platforms, I always
      bring a human-centered approach to my work.</p> <p class="mb-4">I'm also the founder of the Software for Progress Foundation, an incubator
      for developers building Open Source projects that promote education,
      accessibility, and security. Through this work, I help others turn good
      ideas into sustainable, high-impact tools.</p> <p class="mb-4">I specialize in AI for social good, using techniques like
      Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), small local LLMs, and ChromaDB to
      build systems that inform, empower, and protect people. From
      misinformation detection to educational simulations, Iâ€™m focused on
      building ethical, privacy-respecting AI that serves communities, not
      corporations.</p> <p class="mb-4">My technical stack includes Python, Node.js, TypeScript, Dart, and modern
      cloud infrastructure on AWS and GCP. I care deeply about clean code,
      thoughtful UX, and mentorship, because building good software means
      building up the people behind it.</p></div></section>`,1);function w(r,n){d(n,!1);const e=new Date().getFullYear()-2010;p();var o=b(),a=u(o);g(a,{title:"About Me - Cory Chris",description:`I'm Cory Chris, a technology leader and founder with ${e??""} years
